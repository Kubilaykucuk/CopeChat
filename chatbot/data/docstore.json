Blockchain database stores data in blocks connected to each other on a chain. Data is chronologically consistent because the chain cannot be deleted or modified without consensus on the network. In conclusion, blockchain technology can be used to create a ledger that cannot be modified to keep track of orders, payments, accounts, and other transactions. \r\n\r\nHow does blockchain work? \r\nAlthough the underlying blockchain mechanisms are complex, the following steps offer a brief overview of the process. Software of blockchain can automate many of these steps: \r\nStep 1 – Enrollment of process \r\nA blockchain operation indicates physical or digital assets changing hands, shifting from one side of the blockchain network to another. This transaction is saved as a block of data and may include details such as:","metadata":{"source":"src/Copetractapi.txt","loc":{"lines":{"from":144,"to":150}}}}],["11",{"pageContent":"Who is involved in the transaction? \r\nWhat happened during the transaction? \r\nWhen did the transaction take place? \r\nWhere did the transaction take place? \r\nWhy did the transaction take place? \r\nHow much of the asset has changed hands? \r\nHow many prerequisites were met during the transaction? \r\nStep 2 - Ensuring unanimity \r\nMost participants in a distributed blockchain network must acknowledge that the saved operation is valid. Acceptance rules may vary depending on the type of network, but are usually determined during the setup of the network. \r\nStep 3 – Connecting blocks","metadata":{"source":"src/Copetractapi.txt","loc":{"lines":{"from":151,"to":160}}}}],["12",{"pageContent":"Step 3 – Connecting blocks \r\nOnce the participants reach the unanimity, the transactions on the blockchain are written to blocks that are equivalent to the pages of a ledger. With the transactions, an encryption hash is added to the end of the new block. This hash acts as a chain that connects blocks. The hash value changes if the content of the block is changed consciously or inadvertently. This change provides a way to determine if data is tampered with. \r\nThus, blocks and chains are securely linked together and cannot be edited. Each additional block increases the validation strength of the previous block, and therefore the entire blockchain. This process is similar to building a tower by stacking wooden blocks. You can only put the blocks on top, and if you take a block from the middle of the tower, the entire tower collapses. \r\nStep 4 – Sharing the ledger \r\nThe system distributes the latest copy of the central ledger to all participants. \r\n\r\nHow Can I use CopeTract?","metadata":{"source":"src/Copetractapi.txt","loc":{"lines":{"from":160,"to":166}}}}],["13",{"pageContent":"Step 4 – Sharing the ledger \r\nThe system distributes the latest copy of the central ledger to all participants. \r\n\r\nHow Can I use CopeTract?\r\nTo use CopeTract, you first need a crypto wallet.
